# EDA

This are my solutions for the proposed exercises in the class EDA (Data Structures and Algorithms) for the Bachelors in Bioengineering.
I must warn that some of the solutions may not have been tested to their full potential, so, if you detect any mistakes or missed errors, please let me know so I can fixed them.

Hope it helps!
